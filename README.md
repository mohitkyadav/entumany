## Getting Started


```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn start
```

## Motivation
I love learning languages and while doing so I often write down some words or sentenses in different places such as OneNote or other note take apps. Entumany is a mix of this and Duolingo.

## Functionality
Users can add translations between multiple languages. And come back any time and play a simple quiz, in which Entumany shows you one quetion and you input the respactive translation.

There's no need for internet or any account, it works offlie on user's localstorage. It has a beautiful and minimal mobile device focused user interface.
